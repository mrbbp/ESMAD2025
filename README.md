# ESMAD2025
lot of tests i made with Claude.ai for creative coding with ai for workshop at ESMAD, Porto(PT) in February 2025

the __date__ folder will contain the usefull docs we share during workshop.  
The __shared__ folder contain my mess experimentions with ai assited code writing (if i am able to take time i will explain the experimentation's subject)
  
PS: i wanted to apologize for the mess in the code. it's all over the place, because my mind is all over the place.
The older i get the more i realize how many things i want to try.

1. "A Processing script: an SVG loaded and repeated 10 times in height and 10 times in width, in an 800 x 800 sketch. The file is named yellow_arrow.svg and is located in a folder named medias one level above the sketch."
2. "I would like each copy to point towards my mouse position. The svg has an initial orientation of -45Â°"
3. "Can you resize the arrow to 50% of its size?"
4. "I would like to add a circle the size of the window. On which moves another smaller circle, 10% of the sketch size"
5. "The big circle only has an outline and the small one too. Its size must be stored in a variable"
6. "I would like the small circle to position itself on the large circle according to the mouse position"
7. "Now I would like the arrows to follow this circle and not the mouse"
8. "The small circle must be twice as small. The sketch background is light gray. Need to add a grid in a darker gray"
